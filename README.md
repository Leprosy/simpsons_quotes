# The Simpsons quotes
A weird script that generates random dialogues, fetching lines from movies and Simpsons screenshots.
This is definitely my silliest project so far.

The images are fetched from `http://homerize.com/`. The quotes are retrieved from `http://www.imdb.com/`.

# Usage
- Clone the repo and install the dependencies stored on `requirements`
- `python main.py` (this generates a file called `out.jpg`)
- Enjoy...I think
